# Inbound: Web Interface (Payment Page)

Our Payment Pages are different web interfaces (APIs) that can be used to tokenise credit card numbers. For in-
stance, it can be used in the reservation process to guarantee a booking.  

Through our APIs, the guestâ€™s computer communicates directly with our servers to exchange its credit card num-
ber for a credit card token and forwards only the token to your servers. **Hence, channel is PCI compliant**.
