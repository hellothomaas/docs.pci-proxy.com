**Welcome to the Datatrans PCI Proxy Documentation**

_This documentation is currently work in progress!_

PCI Proxy is a service that can securely collect, store and forward credit cards (payment data) to any payment gateway (e.g. Stripe) or other PCI-certified third party (e.g. Expedia). It can even extract payment data out of existing web service calls (e.g. Booking.com) while allowing the message body to remain unaffected. By using tokenization, our APIs ensure sensitive payment data never touches your system environment.

Before you start please consider downloading the recent version of our technical implementation guide and visit the PCI DSS Standard website.
